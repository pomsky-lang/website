## Summary

This document uses Pomsky syntax to describe Pomsky's syntax. Here's an incomplete summary,
which is enough to read the grammar:

- Variables are declared as `let var_name = expression;`#po. This means that `var_name`can be parsed by parsing`expression`.

- Verbatim text is wrapped in double quotes (`""`#po) or single quotes
  (`''`#po).

- A `*`#po after a rule indicates that it repeats 0 or more times.

- A `+`#po after a rule indicates that it repeats 1 or more times.

- A `?`#po after a rule indicates that the rule is optional.

- Rules can be grouped together by wrapping them in parentheses (`()`#po).

- Alternative rules are each preceded by a vertical bar (`|`#po).

## Formal grammar

Comments start with `#` and end at the end of the same line. Comments and whitespace are ignored;
they can be added anywhere between tokens. Tokens are

- identifiers (e.g. `foo`)
- keywords and reserved words (e.g. `lazy`)
- operators and punctuation (e.g. `<<` or `;`)
- numbers (e.g. `30`)
- string literals (e.g. `"foo"`)
- codepoints

as [documented here](/docs/reference/tokens/) in detail.

### Note about this grammar

Even though this grammar is written using Pomsky syntax, it isn't actually accepted by the Pomsky
compiler, because it uses cyclic variables.

### Expression

```pomsky
let Expression = Statement* Alternation;
```

See _[Alternation](/docs/reference/constructs/alternation/)_.

### Statement

```pomsky
let Statement =
    | LetDeclaration
    | Modifier
    | Test;
```

See _[LetDeclaration], [Modifier], [Test]_.

[Modifier]: /docs/reference/constructs/modifier
[Test]: /docs/reference/constructs/tests/

### FixExpression

An expression which can have a prefix or suffix.

```pomsky
let FixExpression =
    | Lookaround
    | Negation
    | Repetition;
```

See _[Lookaround], [Negation], [Repetition]_.

### AtomExpression

```pomsky
let AtomExpression =
    | String
    | CodePoint
    | Group
    | CharacterSet
    | InlineRegex
    | Boundary
    | Reference
    | NumberRange
    | Variable
    | Dot
    | Recursion;
```
