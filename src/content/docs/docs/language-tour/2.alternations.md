What if we want to match multiple strings? Say, we want to match the texts `one`, `two`, `three`,
`four`, and `five`:

```pomsky
'one' | 'two' | 'three' | 'four' | 'five'
```

It's that easy, just separate all alternatives with a vertical bar. This is called an
_alternation_. The `|` can be read as "or", since the above matches `'one'`#po _or_
`'two'`#po _or_ `'three'`#po _or_ `'four'`#po _or_
`'five'`#po.

## Grouping

If we want to concatenate an alternation, we need to wrap it in parentheses:

```pomsky
('blue' | 'yellow' | 'green') 'ish'
```

This matches `blueish`, `yellowish`, and `greenish`. Every expression can be surrounded by
parentheses, this is called a _group_. Here the parentheses are needed to clarify that the `ish`
is concatenated with the entire alternation, not just the `green` part.

## Formatting

When your expression gets so long that it doesn't fit in a single line, it looks better to put every
alternative in a separate line:

```pomsky
'one'
| 'two'
| 'three'
| 'four'
| 'five'
```

But this looks odd, because the first line is not aligned with the others. So Pomsky allows you to
add a _leading vertical bar:_

```pomsky
| 'one'
| 'two'
| 'three'
| 'four'
| 'five'
```
