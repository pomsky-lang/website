Although Pomsky on its own is very powerful, there might be situations where its syntax is not
expressive enough. In these rare situations, Pomsky has an escape hatch: The `regex` keyword allows
specifying an expression that is embedded in the output verbatim, without escaping:

```pomsky
regex 'hello|world?'
```

This emits the following regular expression:

```regexp
hello|world?
```

:::caution

This is **dangerous** and should only be used as a last resort. Pomsky does not parse the content of **regex** expressions, so it cannot ensure that the output is valid.

:::

For example, this is how you could use subroutines (which are not officially supported by Pomsky):

```pomsky
:octet(range '0'-'255') ('.' regex '\g<octet>'){3}
```

Note that Pomsky wraps a `regex` expression in a non-capturing group if it is followed by a
repetition or surrounded by parentheses.

This concludes the language tour! Now you should be able to write and understand Pomsky expressions.
